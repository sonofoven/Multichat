# MultiChat

# Todo
- Fix control flow so clientInfo actually gets updated when FileDetect\-\>Chat Setup
- Fix formWin so it doesn't need a constructor

- Fix control flow so networkStart() creates an error so chat can redirect
- Fix switchToChat so it doesn't need returns under it. I.e. follows normal flow
